# FastAPI template

I love to play with new technologies as much as the next guy,
maybe more, but when it comes to getting work done fast and well,
it's nice to have a consistent tech stack that just works.

It's even nicer to have a preconfigured template of that stack,
with all the bells and whistles, testing suite, build tools,
macros, github actions, and anything else you need.

Thats this repo: fork and get up and running NOW!

WARNING: this is highly subjective. 
The things in this repo are the thing that *I* add to new projects.
You may not want everything in here, or want things not in here.
It's easier to delete what you dont need than to hunt down everything,
so this is a bit of a kitchen sink situation.
If it doesnt fit your needs: fork it, make your own template!

(because this is a template that may have to last years,
version pinning is a MUST! These versions are from when the template was built,
they may be out of date, you may need updates. If you do,
I cannot promise that the new versions of all these packages are compatible,
update at your own risk!)
